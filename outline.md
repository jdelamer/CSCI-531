## Assignment Submission


* Instructions for the submission of assignments will be posted on the course website. It is each student's responsibility to read and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the submission instructions may result in the assignment receiving a mark of zero.
* You will be required to submit each programming assignment electronically. Details will be given in the assignment descriptions. We reserve the right to use similarity detection software to detect possible cheating cases.


## Assignment Due Dates


* The date and exact time assignments are due will be given in the assignment specifications.
* No submissions will be taken after the due date; there are no late submissions.
* No extensions will be given for assignments.


## Assignment Marking

* Assignments are marked by the Teaching Assistants, who follow marking schemes provided by instructors. 
* A request for adjustment in an assignment mark must be made within 2 weeks of the date on which it was first available after marking. (Beyond that date, regrading will not be considered, regardless of whether you retrieved your assignment.) Such a request must be submitted to the course instructor in writing, and must include specific reasons why you believe you deserve more marks. The request must be accompanied by all materials that were originally handed in, as well as the original marker's grade summary sheet. The instructor will inform you by email when the reevaluation process is complete. 
* It is each student's responsibility to keep up-to-date backups of assignment disk files in case of system crashes or inadvertently erased files. Students must keep disk copies of all material submitted, as well as the actual graded assignment, to guard against the possibility of errors in recording marks. It is not safe to discard these materials until you are satisfied that your final mark for the course has been computed properly.


### Tests


No cheating of any form is allowed. Tests and exams are closed book/laptop/notebook/etc. and calculators, cell phones
and/or similar devices are not permitted. The possession of unauthorized devices during tests and examinations
constitutes violation of academic integrity, as per section 3.8.2(b)(v) of the academic calendar. Further, anything that
a reasonable person would deem as cheating is not permitted and will be investigated fully as academic misconduct.

Test format will be in person; however, if necessary, the format *may* be changed to online. Students will be informed
of the change as soon as possible.


### Statement on Electronic Devices


Unless you have medical accommodations that require you to do so, or explicit permission from the instructor of the
course, you may not use electronic devices during any of the tests, midterms, examinations, or
other in-class evaluations, including, but not limited to: cellphones, smart phones, smart watches, smart glasses, audio
players or recorders of any sort, video cameras, video games, DVD players, televisions, laptop/notebook/netbook
computers, flashlights or laser pointers.


### Missed Tests


There are no make-up tests. If a student is unable to write a test, the weight of their test will be added to the
following test or final exam, whichever comes first. If both tests are missed, the weight of the tests will be added to
the final exam.


## Email Contact


I may need to send email messages to the whole class or to students individually. Email will be sent to the StFX email address assigned to students. It is the responsibility of the student to read this email on a regular basis. You may wish to have mail forwarded to an alternative email address. 

Note that StFX and most other email providers establish quotas or limits on the amount of space available to you. If you let your email accumulate there, your mailbox may fill up and you may lose important email from your instructors. Losing email is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing about the information that was sent. 

Students are encouraged to contact their course instructor via email with brief, email appropriate questions regarding lecture materials or clarification of assignments. However, before sending email to an instructor, the student should check the course website to see if the requested information is already there. Students must send email from their StFX account. Lengthy and in-depth questions are to be asked during office hours.

```{important}
- The object of the email must start with `[CSCI-531]`, without it the email could get lost and the response time much longer.
- **Email etiquette** --- Emails should be addressed to Dr./Prof. Delamer.
```

## Attendance


Students missing three classes without reasonable cause will be reported to the Associate Dean. See section 3.7 of the
academic calendar for more details.

You will be reported to the Associate Dean, Academic Affairs' Office if you are repeatedly delinquent in assignments or
attendance at classes or laboratories.


## Copyright Policy


The materials in CSCI 531 at StFX are the property of the instructor, unless stated otherwise by the instructor. Online posting or selling this material to third parties for distribution without permission is subject to Canadian Copyright law and is strictly prohibited.

The course copyright policy will be aggressively enforced. 


## Class Recording Policy


Students may not create audio and/or video recordings of classes. Students creating unauthorized recording of lectures violate an instructor's intellectual property rights and the Canadian Copyright Act. Students violating this policy will be subject to disciplinary actions.


## Statement of Academic Offenses and Academic Integrity

Please ensure that you are aware of the policy on Academic Integrity. Details can be found
[here](https://www.stfx.ca/media/40111/download).

Scholastic offenses are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the
definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offense. See section 3.8 of the academic calendar.

It is your responsibility to understand what academic misconduct is. Ignorance of the rules is not an admissible excuse
for academic misconduct. I will pursue academic offenses fully. I will apply -100% (not 0) as a grade. I will also
advocate for an automatic failure in the course, or expulsion from the university when allowed.


### Use of Plagiarism-Checking Software


All required papers/submissions may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to the commercial plagiarism
detection software under license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers submitted for such
checking will be included as source documents in the reference database for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of
papers subsequently submitted to the system.


### Use of Cheating-Analysis Software


All submitted work may be subject to submission for similarity review by software that will check for unusual
coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating (MOSS).


## Information about Requesting an Accommodation at StFX


If you have a different learning ability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the instructor during
the first week of the semester so that your accommodations may be provided in a timely manner. Centre for Accessible
Learning (CAL) provides assistance in determining and facilitating appropriate accommodations for students with verified
disabilities.
