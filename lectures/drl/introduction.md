# Introduction to Neural Network

Before applyng Neural Networks (NN) to reinforcement learning, NN will be introduced.

## Linear Algebra

Linear algebra and neural networks are strongly linked together, so a good understanding of linear algebra is crucial to create and use NN.

### Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors

Linear algebra involves several types of mathematical objects.

```{prf:definition} Scalars

A scalar is a single number define on a domain.

Notations are in italics lowercase, for example $s\in \mathbb{R}$.

```

```{prf:definition} Vectors

A vector is an array of numbers arranged in order, where each number is identified by its index in the ordering.

Typically, a vector is written with a bold lowercase name, such as $\mathbf{x}$, and each element is idntified by the vector name subscripted by its index (ex: the first element of $\mathbf{x}$ is $x_1$, etc.).

When elements need to be explicitly identfied, the vecto is written as a column neclosed in square brackets:

\[

\mathbf{x} =

\]


```
